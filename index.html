    <div class="m10">Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a
        goal. Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word
        is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in North America, Ireland
        and Australia); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules
        football; rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football.[1] These various forms of football share to varying
        extents common origins and are known as "football codes".
        There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different
        parts of the world.[2][3][4] Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these
        games at English public schools during the 19th century.[5][6] The expansion and cultural influence of the
        British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly
        controlled Empire.[7]
